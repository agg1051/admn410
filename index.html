					<h2>History</h2>
				<p>After becoming a veterinary technician, Lexi Gonzalez discovered there
				were not many sustainable animal companies. So, she decided to create her own.
				In 2020, Lexi's Pet Products sold their first pet product, biodegradeable
				waste bags. The product was an instant success. Lexi's then grew to sell 
				more eco-friendly products! </p>
					<h2> Why Use Us?</h2>
				<p>Lexi's only has the safest products for your pet. All our employees 
				have veterinary knowledge and experience.  </p>
